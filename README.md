# Vancouver Datajam 2023 | ChatBot

**See the chatbot in action [HERE](https://chatbotpy-qeuiewuj5r8h4qxfz4mnkn.streamlit.app/)!**

This repository contains material to create a Chatbot which helps users identify which items can be recycled in BC, and where. This project is part of the Vancouver Datajam 2023 Hackathon.

Disclaimer: Our temporary main branch is "silvia" as there are some merge issues in the main. The app is still running and functional from "silvia" branch.

## Project statement

Solid waste is a direct contributor to climate change as it produces greenhouse gas emissions (methane & nitrous oxide) during decomposition [source](https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/Reduce-Reuse-Recycle/Climate-Change/Climate-Change-and-Waste#:~:text=Our%20Wasteful%20Impact%20on%20Climate%20Change&text=Solid%20waste%20contributes%20directly%20to,our%20solid%20waste%20combustion%20facilities.). 
One way to reduce solid waste and GHGs is to recycle and properly dispose of items which are no longer needed.

Our app aims to reduce the barrier to recycling by providing a convenient way to find out where and what can be recycled. The RecyclePro bot is different from other AI chatbots, because it's trained to provide unique answers to Metro Vancouver.
