## Project statement

Solid waste is a direct contributor to climate change as it produces greenhouse gas emissions (methane & nitrous oxide) during decomposition [source](https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/Reduce-Reuse-Recycle/Climate-Change/Climate-Change-and-Waste#:~:text=Our%20Wasteful%20Impact%20on%20Climate%20Change&text=Solid%20waste%20contributes%20directly%20to,our%20solid%20waste%20combustion%20facilities.). 
One way to reduce solid waste and GHGs is to recycle and properly dispose of items which are no longer needed. We created a recycling chatbot to educate users on which items can be recycled and where.
