# About

This chatbot is tailored to answer BC residents' questions regarding residential packaging and paper recycling. Using information primarily from the [Recycle BC website](https://recyclebc.ca/what-can-i-recycle-2/), the Recycle ProBot uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) on top of OpenAI's GPT-3.5.

This project was part of the Vancouver Datajam 2023 Hackathon, where the theme was climate change. View the GitHub repository [**here**](https://github.com/Vancouver-Datajam/chatbot_tuning/tree/main)

## Project statement

Solid waste is a direct contributor to climate change as it produces greenhouse gas emissions (methane & nitrous oxide) during decomposition [source](https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/Reduce-Reuse-Recycle/Climate-Change/Climate-Change-and-Waste#:~:text=Our%20Wasteful%20Impact%20on%20Climate%20Change&text=Solid%20waste%20contributes%20directly%20to,our%20solid%20waste%20combustion%20facilities.). 
One way to reduce solid waste and GHGs is to recycle and properly dispose of items which are no longer needed. We created a chatbot interface for information from Recycle BC's website.
